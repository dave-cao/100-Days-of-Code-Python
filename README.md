# 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022

In this repository, I will be following Dr. Angela Yu's online bootcamp and
committing 100 projects in 100 days.

The beginning days will start with easier projects that will progressingly
get harder and harder as the days go on.

**Each folder should have a README file that describes what I learned and 
each script should have a description of the function of the program at the
top as a comment**
