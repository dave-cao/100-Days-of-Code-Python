# Day 14 - Beginner - Higher Lower Game Project

Make a game that tells the user to guess if a person has more or less
instagram followers. 

If the user chooses the one with a higher follower count, then they get one point
and the game continues. 

If the user chooses the one with a lower follower count, then game over.
