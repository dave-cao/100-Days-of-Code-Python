# Day 47 - Intermediate+ Create an Automated Amazon Price Tracker

A program that checks the prices of products on Amazon and notifies me when it's
a good buy time.

1. Webscrape the Amazon webpage for the price of a certain product (beautiful soup)
2. Check the price against your low for that item (you can check camelcamelcamel for historic lows)
3. Send an email to myself saying that theres a new low
