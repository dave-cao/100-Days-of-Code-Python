# Day 11 - Beginner - The Blackjack Capstone Project

Capstone project

Essentially, the game is played between the user and the computer. The player gets
assigned two cards and you are shown one card from the computer. 

Your goal is to get a number as close to but not over 21. You will get an option
to draw another card or pass. If you pass, the winner is determined by the number
closest to 21 but not over.


Here are the [official rules](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/) of the game.
