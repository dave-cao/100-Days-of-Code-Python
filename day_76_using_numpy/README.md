np.array(): creates an array for us
np.arrange(): generates an array for us with start stop step
np.random.random(): generate a random array
np.linspace(): generates an array with a certain number of numbers within a range


Learned about broadcasting and maniuplating images in the form of ndarrays...
To flip an image, you just have to reverse the 3d array!
